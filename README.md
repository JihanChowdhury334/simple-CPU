A simple CPU was designed and implemented on an FPGA, featuring core components such as an ALU, control unit, and
registers. The ALU was responsible for performing 8-bit arithmetic and logic operations based on opcodes, while the
registers provided synchronized data storage for inputs. A finite state machine (FSM) and a 3-to-8 decoder were used
to control the sequencing of operations and opcode translation. The system's 8-bit output was configured to display
results on 7-segment displays.
